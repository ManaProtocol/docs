# âš– Rebalancing

## How does rebalancing work?

When users buy or sell a specific mana color the exchange rate changes. We will restore the balance by buying low cost mana colors and selling high cost mana colors. This is also how we make our protocol profitable. Everyone is invited to rebalance and make profits this way.
