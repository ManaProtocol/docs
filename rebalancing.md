# âš– Rebalancing

## How does rebalancing work?

When users buy or sell a specific mana token for other mana tokens the exchange rate changes. Everyone can restore the balance by buying low cost mana tokens and selling high cost mana tokens. This is one way how you can make profits with mana. Everyone is invited to rebalance and make profits this way.
